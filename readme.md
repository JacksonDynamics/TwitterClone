# Twitter Clone

### This was a great project that allowed me to stretch my javascript. I studied and implemented

- textarea
- .forEach()
- data attributes
- conditionally rendered styles
- NOT operators (!)
- CDN's

### Lots of good information, and gave me the ability to create a project that mimics a Twitter comment page.  Fully functional comment box, replies, likes, retweets, and profiles. handle
